# Post-reconstruction 3D phase retrieval (PHRT3D)
Sample data and Python code for the article: F. Brun et al., [Post-reconstruction 3D single-distance phase retrieval for multi-stage phase-contrast tomography with photon-counting detectors](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600577519000237), Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, 26(2):510-516, 2019.

**Note**: The code is not optimized for performances. It requires a machine with at least 64GB of RAM. Execution is about a minute on a modern multi-core PC.
